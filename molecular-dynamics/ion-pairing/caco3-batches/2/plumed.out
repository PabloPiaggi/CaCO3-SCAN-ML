PLUMED: FILE: plumed.dat
PLUMED: Action DISTANCE
PLUMED:   with label d
PLUMED:   between atoms 1 2
PLUMED:   using periodic boundary conditions
PLUMED: Action OPES_METAD
PLUMED:   with label opes
PLUMED:   with arguments d
PLUMED:   added component to this action:  opes.bias 
PLUMED:   added component to this action:  opes.rct 
PLUMED:   added component to this action:  opes.zed 
PLUMED:   added component to this action:  opes.neff 
PLUMED:   added component to this action:  opes.nker 
PLUMED:   temperature = 330
PLUMED:   beta = 0.364462
PLUMED:   depositing new kernels with PACE = 500
PLUMED:   expected BARRIER is 50
PLUMED:   using target distribution with BIASFACTOR gamma = 18.2231
PLUMED:   adaptive SIGMA will be used, with ADAPTIVE_SIGMA_STRIDE = 5000
PLUMED:     thus the first x kernel depositions will be skipped, x = ADAPTIVE_SIGMA_STRIDE/PACE = 10
PLUMED:   kernels are truncated with KERNELS_CUTOFF = 6.20985
PLUMED:   the value at cutoff is = 4.22965e-09
PLUMED:   regularization EPSILON = 4.22965e-09
PLUMED:   kernels will be compressed when closer than COMPRESSION_THRESHOLD = 1
