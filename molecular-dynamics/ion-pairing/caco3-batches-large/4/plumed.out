PLUMED: File suffix: 
PLUMED: FILE: plumed.dat
PLUMED: Action DISTANCE
PLUMED:   with label d
PLUMED:   between atoms 1433 857
PLUMED:   using periodic boundary conditions
PLUMED: Action OPES_METAD
PLUMED:   with label opes
PLUMED:   with arguments d
PLUMED:   added component to this action:  opes.bias 
PLUMED:   multiple time step 2 [3]
PLUMED:   added component to this action:  opes.rct 
PLUMED:   added component to this action:  opes.zed 
PLUMED:   added component to this action:  opes.neff 
PLUMED:   added component to this action:  opes.nker 
PLUMED:   temperature = 330
PLUMED:   beta = 0.364462
PLUMED:   depositing new kernels with PACE = 500
PLUMED:   expected BARRIER is 30
PLUMED:   using target distribution with BIASFACTOR gamma = 10.9339
PLUMED:   adaptive SIGMA will be used, with ADAPTIVE_SIGMA_STRIDE = 5000
PLUMED:     thus the first x kernel depositions will be skipped, x = ADAPTIVE_SIGMA_STRIDE/PACE = 10
PLUMED:   kernels are truncated with KERNELS_CUTOFF = 4.90602
PLUMED:   the value at cutoff is = 5.93575e-06
PLUMED:   regularization EPSILON = 5.93575e-06
PLUMED:   kernels will be compressed when closer than COMPRESSION_THRESHOLD = 1

PLUMED:   with an offset 0.000000
PLUMED:   with force constant 1000.000000
PLUMED:   and exponent 2.000000
PLUMED:   rescaled 1.000000
PLUMED:   added component to this action:  uwall.force2 
PLUMED: Action PRINT
PLUMED:   with label @3
